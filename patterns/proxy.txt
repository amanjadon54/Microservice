Proxy pretends being an object when in fact it's not. 

There are several types of proxies:

Remote proxy ("Ambassador") - we have client and server, instead of communicating between server's and client's 
classes we create a proxy on client side, and a proxy on server side, and only the proxies communicate

Virtual proxy - creates expensive object on first demand; it can also hold information about the object which is
not instantiated yet (e.g. height and width of an image)

Protection proxy - to control access

Smart proxy - just an addition to an object, to have more control, e.g. lock/unlock, conuting number of references 
(to later destroy if no references)
