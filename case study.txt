Scenario: Drone delivery
Fabrikam, Inc. is starting a drone delivery service. The company manages a fleet of drone aircraft. Businesses register 
with the service, and users can request a drone to pick up goods for delivery. When a customer schedules a pickup,
a backend system assigns a drone and notifies the user with an estimated delivery time. While the delivery is in progress,
the customer can track the location of the drone, with a continuously updated ETA.

This scenario involves a fairly complicated domain. Some of the business concerns include scheduling drones, tracking packages,
managing user accounts, and storing and analyzing historical data. Moreover, Fabrikam wants to get to market quickly and 
then iterate quickly, adding new functionality and capabilities. The application needs to operate at cloud scale, with a 
high service level objective (SLO). Fabrikam also expects that different parts of the system will have very different 
requirements for data storage and querying. All of these considerations lead Fabrikam to choose a microservices architecture
for the Drone Delivery application.
