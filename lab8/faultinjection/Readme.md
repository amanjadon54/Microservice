Fault injection 

There are two types of faults 

Delays — are timing failures.
They mimic increased network latency or an overloaded upstream service. 

Aborts — are crash failures. 
They mimic failures in upstream services. Aborts usually manifest in the form of HTTP error codes or TCP connection failures.
