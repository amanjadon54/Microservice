Resiliency

1. Timeouts

2. Retries

3. Circuit breakers

4. Fault injection
There are two types of faults 
Delays — are timing failures. They mimic increased network latency or an overloaded upstream service.
Aborts — are crash failures. They mimic failures in upstream services. Aborts usually manifest in the form of HTTP error codes or TCP connection failures.
