Shadowing or Mirroring is used when we want to test a change in production but not affect end-users, so we mirror the requests into a second instance that has the change and evaluate it. 

You can incorporate a traffic mirroring rule as part of a canary deployment pipeline, allowing you to analyze a service's behavior before sending live traffic to it.

mirrored requests are “fire and forget.”
